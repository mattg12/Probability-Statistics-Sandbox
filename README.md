# Probability-Statistics-Sandbox
Various projects to explore concepts in probability and statistics

## Purpose
The goal of these 'mini-projects' is to experiment with concepts in probability and statistics, leveraging programming languages to better understand distributions, theorems, results, and applications. These projects will be added and edited as needed, and as the repo name suggests, this will mostly be exploratory work rather than finished projects.
